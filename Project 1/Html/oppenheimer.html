<h3>Birth behind his genius mind</h3>
<section class="oppen-text">
<p style="width: 80%;">J.Robert Oppenheimer was a American scientist and was one of the most important persons in the making of the atomic bomb.
    Oppenheimer was born in 1904, New york city. His family were German jewish immigrants who found wealth in textile trading.
    The young Oppenheimer who was often called ¨Oppie¨ graduated from harvard school after just only 3 years. After Harvard he then went to both cambridge, UK. And Göttingen in Germany were he studied
    theoretical physics. He then gained his doctorate at age 23.
    He studied advanced quantum theory and soon predicted everything from the neutron
    to the black hole. That wasnt the only thing he learned.
    Along science, he also studied religion and learned sanskrit.

    <p style="width: 80%;">
    The United States then joined the Allies after Japan attacked pearl harbour. Oppenheimer was asked to participate in a top-secret project called the Manhattan Project.
    The Manhattan project was a code name for the American-led effort to develope a functional atomic weapon during World war 2. There were rumors that Adolf Hitler, Leader of Nazi Germany was
    already working on a atomic bomb since the 1930s and was prepared to use it. Some of the worlds leading scientist alongside Oppenheimer as well as the US Military tried to get ahead of the Germans by developing the first Atomic bomb.
    Most of the work was done in a remote dessert in Los Alamos, New Mexico.
